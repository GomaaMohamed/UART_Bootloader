# UART_Bootloader
```
>> The UART Bootloader updates the software of STM32F103 through UART.
>> We utilized the host application to transmit the hex file via UART.
>> The project comprises the Host App, Bootloader, and a Blinking Example App.

## Host App
### Getting Started
```
- This C code sends the Hex File record by record through the serial port.
- Sending the next record is not permitted until an OK message is received from the target.
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- gcc
- make
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. Modify the path of the project home in the host app's makefile.
3. Navigate to the host_app folder in the terminal and compile the application
   to generate the executable.
```
$ make all
"An executable named "burner" will be generated in binary format"
```
### Usage
1. Modify the permissions of the serial port that will be utilized.
```
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
2. Transmit the Hex File
```
$ ./burner ./app.hex /dev/ttyUSB0
```

## Bootloader
### Getting Started
```
- This is the bootloader that will be utilized to receive and burn the Hex File sent from the host app.
- It is not permissible to receive a Hex record before analyzing and burning the previous one.
- The bootloader comprises the MCAL layer that includes the drivers of the MCU, and an APP layer
  that contains the software components of the application.
- The Interface Module receives the Hex File record by record and sends it to the Parser Module.
- The Parser Module analyzes the Hex record, performs checksum, converts the Hex record from ASCII to Hex,
  sets endianess, and sends the binary instructions to the Burner Module.
- The Burner Module burns and verifies the binary instructions in the internal flash.
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- make
- st-flash
- gdb-multiarch
- openocd
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. change the path of the project home in makefile of the bootloader
3. set the memory boundries through linker.ld
4. Open the terminal inside the host_app folder and build the application to get the executable
```
$ make all
"this will generate a binary executable named app.hex(this is the bootloader executable)"
```
5. burn the bootloader
```
$ make flash
```
### Usage
1. To build the Project
```
$ make all
```
2. To clean the Project
```
$ make clean
```
3. To erase the flash
```
$ make erase
```
4. To burn the Project
```
$ make flash
```
5. To debug the Project
```
$ ./openport
  "this bash script will open a remote telnet port on the target using openocd"
$ ./startgdb ./app.elf
  "this bash script will start a debug session using gdb-multiarch"
```
## Blinking Application
### Getting Started
```
- This is the application that will be burned using the bootloader flash
- It is a Led blinks every second 
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- make
- st-flash
- gdb-multiarch
- openocd
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. change the path of the project home in makefile of the application
3. set the memory boundries through linker.ld
4. Open the terminal inside the host_app folder and build the application to get the hex file
```
$ make all
"this will generate a binary executable named app.hex(this application executable)"
```
5. burn the bootloader
   "As mentioned on the Hoast App"
