# UART_Bootloader
```
>> This is a UART Bootloader to update the Software of STM32F103 through UART
>> We used the host application to send the hex file through the UART
>> The project consist of the Host App, Bootloadear, and a Blinking Example App

## Block Definition Diagram for the System

## Host App
### Getting Started
```
- This is a C code used to send the Hex File Record by Record through the serial Port
- It's not allowed to send the next Record before recieving an OK message from the target 
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- gcc
- make
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. change the path of the project home in makefile of the host app
3. Open the terminal inside the host_app folder and build the application to get the executable
```
$ make all
"this will generate a binary executable named burner"
```
### Usage
1. Change the permissions of the serial port that will be used
```
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
2. Send the Hex File
```
$ ./burner ./app.hex /dev/ttyUSB0
```

## Bootloader
### Getting Started
```
- This is the bootloader that will be used to recieve the hex file from host app and burns it
- It's not allowed to recieve a hex record before analysing and burning the previous one
- The bootloader consists of the mcal layer that contains the drivers of mcu
- Additionally it consisst of the app layer that contains the software components of the application
  Interface Module: recieves the hex file record by record and send it to Parser Module
  Parser Module: analyses the hex record, perform check sum convert hex record from ascci to hex,
                 sets endianess, and sends the binary istructions to Burner Module
  Burner Module: burns, and verifies the binary instructions in the internal flash
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- make
- st-flash
- gdb-multiarch
- openocd
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. change the path of the project home in makefile of the bootloader
3. set the memory boundries through linker.ld
4. Open the terminal inside the host_app folder and build the application to get the executable
```
$ make all
"this will generate a binary executable named app.hex(this is the bootloader executable)"
```
5. burn the bootloader
```
$ make flash
```
### Usage
1. To build the Project
```
$ make all
```
2. To clean the Project
```
$ make clean
```
3. To erase the flash
```
$ make erase
```
4. To burn the Project
```
$ make flash
```
5. To debug the Project
```
$ ./openport
  "this bash script will open a remote telnet port on the target using openocd"
$ ./startgdb ./app.elf
  "this bash script will start a debug session using gdb-multiarch"
```
## Blinking Application
### Getting Started
```
- This is the application that will be burned using the bootloader flash
- It is a Led blinks every second 
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- make
- st-flash
- gdb-multiarch
- openocd
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. change the path of the project home in makefile of the application
3. set the memory boundries through linker.ld
4. Open the terminal inside the host_app folder and build the application to get the hex file
```
$ make all
"this will generate a binary executable named app.hex(this application executable)"
```
5. burn the bootloader
   "As mentioned on the Hoast App"
